# RASTIC - Motion Capture and AgileX Limo Tutorial
Welcome to Boston University's RASTIC Lab Space! This repository holds the scripts necessary to run the Motion Capture and AgileX Limos Tutorial (although not the ROS workspace or package). 


## Setup
line_follower.py and cav_for_line_follower.py are for coordination on the RASTIC Linux laptop, while limo_cmd_listener.py is for the listener on the limo. For easy use, the files are already downloaded and set up in the RASTIC Linux Dell laptop and Limo#780. Further instructions can be found in the Tutorial Documentation. 

We do not currently have documentation on how to run this tutorial on a personal device. 

## Before you start

Please talk to a RASTIC employee before starting this tutorial. To prevent any accidental injuries and damage to the Limos, we recommend you to do this tutorial in pairs, or to have a RASTIC employee assist you. 

The detailed documentation can be found in the RASTIC Google Drive, under "Manuals and Machine Instructions" -> "RASTIC Written Manuals" -> "Motion Capture & AgileX Limo Tutorial.pdf" or can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GxMvOqho1vlr5g5xVx1SV0V92FE-8llr/view?usp=sharing  "here")
