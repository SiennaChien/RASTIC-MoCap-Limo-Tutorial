## Setup
line_follower.py and cav_for_line_follower.py are ran on the RASTIC dell laptop, limo_cmd_listener.py is ran on the limo. For easy use, the files are already downloaded and set up in the RASTIC laptop and Limo#780. Further instructions can be found in the Tutorial Documentation. 

We do not currently have documentation on how to run this tutorial on a local device. 

## Before you start

Please talk to a RASTIC employee before starting this tutorial. To prevent any accidental injuries and damage to the limos, we recommend you to do this tutorial in pairs, or to have a RASTIC employee assist you. 

The detailed documentation can be found in the RASTIC Google Drive, under "Manuals and Machine Instructions" -> "RASTIC Written Manuals" -> "Motion Capture & AgileX Limo Tutorial.pdf"
